The Biocybernetic Loop Engine is an integrated software tool designed for an easy creation of physiologically modulated videogames by means of wearable sensors. The BL Engine includes a signal acquisition panel, which facilitates the connectivity of multiple cardiac-related physiological sensors and the processing of the signals, a biocybernetic console to rapidly create and iterate adaptive rules using a visual scripting module, and a game connector tool that ties physiological modulations to game variables.

The KAVE is a Unity plugin that: 

- Adds parallax effect to Unity projects through Kinect v2 head tracking. 
- Supports up to 8 screens/projectors in any physical configuration (normal desktop screen, CAVE, etc...). 
- Features full skeleton tracking for interaction with virtual objects.
